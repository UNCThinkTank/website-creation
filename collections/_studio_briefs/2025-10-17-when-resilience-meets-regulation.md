summary: >
  Legislatures across the Southeast and Mountain West are fast-tracking resilience rules that used to take years.
  The states moving first are pairing reliability mandates with incentives for distributed energy resources, and the
  regulatory experiments underway could shape federal modernization dollars in 2026.
key_points:
  - "**Microgrid carve-outs** in Louisiana, North Carolina, and Colorado create fast-lane permits for campus-scale resilience hubs."
  - "**Stress-test transparency** is now a legislative norm—five states require public reporting of black start and cyber exercises."
  - "**Industrial competitiveness** narratives are winning appropriations fights by tying resilience to manufacturing recruitment."
call_to_action:
  heading: "Bring this resilience brief to your stakeholders"
  body: "We can translate these state moves into tailored watchlists, data stories, or coalition-ready talking points."

## Signal Watch

States are bundling climate adaptation legislation with industrial retention packages. In committee hearings, lawmakers framed
“energy surety” as synonymous with workforce stability. Utility commissions are now fielding concurrent dockets on resilience standards,
performance-based regulation, and rate recovery for distributed investments. The pace of these hearings sets the stage for a dense 2026
rulemaking calendar.

## Why It Matters

- **Federal leverage.** The U.S. Department of Energy is flagging states with resilience procurement programs as early candidates for
  infrastructure matching grants.
- **Cross-sector alliances.** Manufacturing trade groups, hospital associations, and county emergency managers are testifying at the same
  table—an unusual alignment that accelerates bill markups.
- **Regulatory spillover.** Utilities piloting resilience tariffs in one jurisdiction are repositioning those pilots as “best practice” in
  neighboring states within a single session.

## Policy Moves To Watch

1. **Dual-track compliance.** Expect states to pair new reliability metrics with voluntary resilience scores that local governments can use
   for insurance negotiations.
2. **Data-sharing compacts.** Emergency management agencies are negotiating MOUs with grid operators to publish outage restoration time
   targets that used to stay private.
3. **Resilience fee debates.** Legislatures are trial-ballooning line-item fees for resilience investments, borrowing from broadband surcharges.

## Studio POV

Poli Plot Labs is tracking these legislative cycles because they change how we visualize risk for clients and public partners. The studio is
testing dashboards that fuse outage, supply chain, and workforce datasets into “activation sheets” a governor’s office can use during extreme
weather briefings. The current moment is the window to prototype those tools with state partners before the 2026 federal funding wave.
