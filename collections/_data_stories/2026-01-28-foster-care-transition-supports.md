      Each year, approximately 20,000 children and youth age out of foster care
      and are expected to suddenly live on their own ([U.S. Department of
      Education](https://www.ed.gov/teaching-and-administration/supporting-students/special-populations/students-foster-care/students-in-foster-care)).
      Without consistent family or community support, these youth face a
      heightened risk of significant challenges in achieving stable adulthood,
      including unemployment, homelessness, and interrupted education
      ([Lansing et al., 2021](https://acf.gov/opre/report/how-employment-programs-can-support-young-people-transitioning-out-foster-care)).
    - >-
      To test whether transition services help, we analyzed national data from
      the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), tracking more than 8,400
      foster youth across multiple states. We focused on whether receiving
      services before age 19 was associated with employment, school enrollment,
      or stable housing at age 19.

        Overall, the results were discouraging. Most services showed little to
        no measurable impact on employment or school enrollment, and any
        differences were too small to be meaningful.
      - >-
        Average effects clustered around zero, with housing outcomes trending
        negative for youth who received services, signaling that current
        supports may not be strong or durable enough.

        One service stood out: budgeting and financial management training.
        Youth who received this support were about six percentage points more
        likely to be employed at age 19, the only clear positive effect in the
        analysis.
      - >-
        Housing outcomes were especially concerning. Youth who received
        services before age 19 were less likely to report stable housing at 19.
        This does not mean services caused housing instability, but it suggests
        broader service access alone is not enough to prevent homelessness.

        caption: "States offering more services per youth do not necessarily see lower homelessness rates, underscoring limits of broad service expansion."

        The data also revealed persistent racial disparities. Black youth and
        American Indian or Alaska Native youth were significantly less likely
        to be employed or stably housed than White youth, regardless of service
        receipt.
      - >-
        Enrollment rates show uneven access to educational stability across
        groups, reinforcing the need for targeted, equity-focused supports.

        caption: "Enrollment at age 19 varies sharply by race, with Black and AI/AN youth trailing the national pattern."

    paragraphs:
      - >-
        The policy takeaway is clear: expanding one-size-fits-all services is
        unlikely to move outcomes. Instead, policymakers should prioritize
        targeted skill-building programs, especially financial management,
        employment readiness, and independent living supports. These are
        low-cost, scalable, and tied to the only service with a measurable
        payoff.
      - >-
        If we want better outcomes for youth leaving foster care, we need to
        invest in what actually helps them build stable, independent lives.
methodology:
  title: "Methodology"
  paragraphs:
    - >-
      We used National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) data for more than
      8,400 youth across multiple states, comparing outcomes at age 19 for those
      who did and did not receive transition services before age 19.
    - >-
      A difference-in-differences approach compares changes over time for youth
      who did and did not receive services. The data are observational, so
      results should be interpreted with caution.
